                        <h2>Biography</h2>
                        <p>Internationally renowned among the great aficionados of flamenco, Estrella Morena of Madrid made her debut at the age of 15 as “bailaora” of flamenco at the famous Tablao LOS CANASTEROS of Manolo Caracol.  At 16 she was also soloist at the Tablao TORRES BERMEJAS.  Shortly thereafter, she made her debut as principal dancer at the great TEATRO DE LA ZARZUELA in Madrid, and later as principal dancer at the tablao DUENDE for a period of 2 years.</p>
                        <p>In 1969 she moved to New York where she met and auditioned for Antonio Ruiz Soler (a/k/a The Great Antonio) and was contracted for 4 years as principal dancer with his company, returning once again to Madrid.  During this 4-year period, she traveled 10 countries in Europe and the Orient with great success.  At the end of her contract with The Great Antonio she traveled another 7 countries as the special guest artist with Rafael de Córdoba.</p>
                        <p>Estrella has appeared in television in Spain and Japan and also appeared in Rafael de Córdoba’s rendition of the movie El Amor Brujo.  At the end of her professional liaison with Rafael de Córdoba, Estrella formed her own company which toured throughout of Spain.  She was also contracted by the Hilton Hotels in Manila, Philippines with much success.</p>
                        <p>In 1974 she once again returned to New York where she performed at the Hotel Pier before the king and queen of Spain.  The following years brought great success which included performances in CARNEGIE HALL and CARNEGIE RECITAL HALL, HUNTER COLLEGE, INSTITUTO ESPAÑOL, CIRCULO CULTURAL DE LA CASA DE ESPAÑA, THE BARBIZON PLAZA THEATER, and TOWN HALL, which was sponsored by the Spanish Consulate in New York.  Estrella also traveled extensively throughout the U.S. and Canada with the famous José Greco for special productions.</p>
                        <p>In 1985 Estrella moved with her family to Miami where she established herself as an artist alongside her husband, Pepe de Malaga, and her son, Jose Moreno, where they have collectively performed successfully in some of the best flamenco tablaos in Miami, including Costa Vasca.</p>
                        <p>Estrella began her training and choreography in 1969 at a very young age, at the same time she became principal dancer with the Great Antonio, where she received training from some of the best teachers and choreographers from Madrid, which today have become master teachers and choreographers with the National Ballet of Spain.</p>
                        <p>In July of 1990 Estrella commemorated the opening of her own dance academy, Estrella Morena Flamenco, imparting to her students the many years of knowledge and training to flamenco aficionados from beginners to professional, adults and children, and also offering training in classical Spanish and regional dances.</p>
                        <p>The art of Flamenco is strongly rooted in its community, strengthening its cultural identity and continuing to be passed down from one generation to the next.  On November 16, 2010, The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) recognized flamenco as a World Heritage Treasure.  Estrella’s objective is to teach the art of flamenco and the various forms of dance from Spain to anyone who has a desire to learn, whether as a hobby or to train on a professional level; her goal is to continue creating new values without compromising the pure art form of flamenco to anyone who desires to dance well!</p>
